## Small Two Stage Bootloader and C Kernel (WIP)

I know a lot about 16 real mode and boot sectors but not everything about it. I
am doing this small project to learn even more, after all knowledge is power. This
project will show you how to write a two stage boot loader written in NASM (Net-wide Assembler), also with a simple kernel
written in pure C.

### TODO

 - [x] - First stage boot loader (for loading second stage).
 - [x] - Second stage boot loader (for loading kernel).
 - [x] - Simple starter kernel written in C.

### Developer

 - Philip R. Simonson (aka 5n4k3)

### License

 - None [ATM] (At This Moment)
