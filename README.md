## Small Two Stage Bootloader and C Kernel (WIP)

I know a lot about 16 real mode and boot sectors but not everything about it. I
am doing this small project to learn even more, after all knowledge is power. This
project will show you how to write a two stage boot loader written in NASM (Net-wide Assembler), also with a simple kernel
written in pure C.

### Status

	- [X] - First stage boot loader (for loading second stage).
	- [ ] - Second stage boot loader (for loading kernel).
	- [ ] - Simple starter kernel written in C.

### TODO

	- [X] - Fix everything that is wrong with first stage loader.
	- [ ] - Fix everything that is wrong with second stage loader.
  - [ ] - Make a simple starter C kernel.

### Developer

	- Philip R. Simonson (aka 5n4k3)

### License
